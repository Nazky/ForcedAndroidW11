Some computer have the system requirements but not let you install android so here is a simple script to download and install the WSA. (Windows Subsystem for Android)

with the the latest version WSA is going to be install with gapps :)

RUN THE SCRIPT IN ADMIN !!!!!!!!!!

if you have a error use this to update the link : https://pastebin.com/heFukQix (i try to find a way to have a static link)

## System Requirements

| Minimum      | Recommended     |
|--------------|-----------|
| Windows 10 version 22000.63 or higher | Windows 10 version 22000.63 or higher      |
| ARM64, x64 | ARM64, x64  |
| 8 GB | 16 GB  |
| Availability: Only available to Windows 11 Insiders on Beta Channel in the US. |

## F.A.Q

### I have a error when i run the script why ?
#### Post the error in the issues section or contact me on twitter

### The ADB command is not working why ?
#### Run the WSA once (by running a app like the file app or amazon or play store)

### I can't connect to my Google account why ?
#### This is a "bug" and you need to fix it by using my script and choose the "fix Google sign in" option or by using adb manually (after every reboot of the WSA you need to fix it)

### You'r english is sh*t
#### Yeah i know and i am tired sorry lol
